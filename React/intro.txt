# React: A JavaScript library to build user interfaces
    - Introduced in 2013 by Facebook (Meta)
    - Declarative library (We need to tell React what to)
    - Advantages of React.js
        - Built on top of JavaScript
    - React is faster than traditional applications
        - Virtual DOM: Copy of the real DOM
            - Real DOM (Document Object Model)
        - Reconciliation: updating the real DOM optimally with only updating the affected nodes
            - Diffing: compare old virtual DOM with new virtual DOM
        - SPA: Single page application
    -  Websites built on React: Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, Instagram, Asana, Salesforce, Reddit, etc.

        1. Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
            - NPM: Node Package Manager
            - Run:
                - node -v: Node version
                - npm -v: NPM version
        2. Using Vite (Create a react app locally): 
            - npm create vite@latest
            - Give the project a name
            - Framework: choose React
            - Variant: choose JavaScript
            - Use rolldown-vite? No
            - Install with npm and start now? Yes
        3. Enter the folder within the terminal
            - cd (name of folder) react-fundamentals in this case
        4. Start the application
            - If you stop running the app and want to start again, use the command: npm run dev
                - React compiles code and creates a js file understandable by the browser
