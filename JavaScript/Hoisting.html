                - Initializations and assignements are not hoisted

            - Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
                - let and const keyword are hosited, but they continue to remain in TDZ until it is assigned a value
                - JavaScript is aware of the variable/constant created using let/const, but it can't be accessed until it has been declared/initialized.
